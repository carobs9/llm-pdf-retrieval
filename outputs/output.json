      "title": "Shinto Certification and Religious Differentiation: Domain Shinto in Early Modern Okayama",
      "abstract": "Ikeda Mitsumasa’s Shinto-related reforms in Okayama domain in the later 1660s have hitherto been interpreted as measures of local relevance. By applying the Domain Shinto paradigm to this case, however, it becomes clear that the reforms are local manifestations of a much broader appreciation of Shinto among daimyo of Tokugawa kin. Mitsumasa’s reforms are best known for the adoption of religious certification via Shinto shrines (shintō-uke) instead of Buddhist temples (terauke) as part of the practice of sectarian registration (shūmon aratame). In Okayama, this brought about a domain-wide separation of Shinto and Buddhism (shinbutsu bunri), a most radical measure that had to be abandoned under the regime of Mitsumasa’s successor Ikeda Tsunamasa. Nevertheless, this article demonstrates that Okayama’s Domain Shinto reforms brought about a lasting functional differentiation between Shinto and Buddhist clergy leading to a professional Shinto priesthood even at the level of village shrines. Thus, Okayama became a pioneer region in regard to the development of Shinto autonomy.",

      "results": "The 1660s were a period of administrative consolidation for Tokugawa religious policy. Whereas previously the bakufu had issued particularized regulations for certain groups, it now turned towards national laws, mandatory for religious institutions in general. Under the aegis of Hoshina Masayuki—step-uncle, tutor, and advisor (hosa) of shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna, and the bakufu’s pivotal political actor until the mid-1660s—groundbreaking laws regulating religious traditions and sectarian inspection (shūmon aratame) were promulgated. All in all, religious reforms under the two Ikeda daimyo resulted in one of the first major examples in Japan of shinbutsu bunri, the separation of Shinto and Buddhism. This implied a separate Shinto clergy, with separate sanctuaries and a separate way of sectarian certification via shintō-uke. Domain Shinto in Okayama also had other aspects, such as Confucian ancestor worship being combined with daimyo deification at shrines, and these remain as a topic for research in the future."
